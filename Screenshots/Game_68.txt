Each level is unique and offers its own challenges and difficulties.

In one part of the maze there is a gem, and in the other there is an exit from the maze. Your task is to guide the gem to the exit using the maze's reversal mechanisms.

To control the maze, you have two buttons at the bottom of the screen. One button allows you to turn the maze clockwise, and the other - counterclockwise. By pressing one of these buttons, you make the maze rotate and the gem begins to move under the influence of gravity.

The maze consists of various obstacles and moving elements that can block passages. You need to take into account their movement and strategically plan your actions to guide the gem to the exit.

You have a limited amount of time to complete the level. The timer is displayed at the top of the screen. If time runs out before you swipe the gem to the exit, the level will be considered lost.

The maze may also contain additional timers, hitting which with a gem will increase the remaining time and give you a chance to successfully complete the level.

There are also blue gems located in various places throughout the labyrinth. By collecting them, you can accumulate a game score, which is displayed at the top of the screen next to the timer. These blue gems can be used in the in-game shop to purchase new designs for your in-game gem.
